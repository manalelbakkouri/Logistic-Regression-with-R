   # Logistic-Regression-with-R

##🔧 Predictive Maintenance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **predictive maintenance** using an industrial dataset. The goal is to analyze machine failures based on operational conditions and equipment status. By leveraging statistical tests and regression modeling, we aim to enhance failure prediction and prevention.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive plots to explore patterns.
- **Statistical Modeling**:
  - Logistic regression implementation in **R**.
  - Statistical tests: **Anderson-Darling**, **Lilliefors**, **Breusch-Godfrey**, **Breusch-Pagan**.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between input variables (`X`) and the target variable (`Y`).

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains crucial operational and equipment condition data, enabling the modeling and prediction of failures.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-maintenance.git
   cd predictive-maintenance
   ```

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Visual and statistical insights on **machine failures**.
- Predictive modeling to prevent unexpected breakdowns.
- Correlation analysis to identify key influencing factors.
